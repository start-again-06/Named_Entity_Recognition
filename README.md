# üß† Named Entity Recognition (NER) using DistilBERT and TensorFlow

This project builds a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model using DistilBERT and TensorFlow. It processes annotated text data in DataTurks format and trains a transformer-based model to identify named entities such as people, organizations, and locations.

---

## üìÇ Input Format

The dataset should be in JSON format, where each entry includes:

- `"content"`: the raw text
- `"annotation"`: a list of labeled entity spans with:
  - Entity label(s)
  - Character-level start and end positions
  - The exact matched text

This format is compatible with exports from annotation tools like DataTurks.

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Pipeline

### 1. Data Preprocessing

- Read the JSON data line by line.
- Remove newline characters and unnecessary fields (e.g., `extras`).
- Normalize spacing and format the content.

### 2. Entity Span Extraction

- Extract entity spans and labels from the annotations.
- Merge overlapping or adjacent spans that have the same label.

### 3. Format Conversion

- Convert data into a format compatible with spaCy and Hugging Face Transformers.
- Trim whitespaces from entity boundaries to ensure clean alignment.

### 4. Label Encoding

- Create mappings for each entity label to a unique ID.
- Tag each word/token with its corresponding entity label.
- Pad or truncate the tag sequences to a fixed length (e.g., 512 tokens).

### 5. Tokenization and Alignment

- Use a pretrained DistilBERT tokenizer to tokenize text.
- Align the tokenized words with their entity labels.
- Handle subword tokens with optional label propagation logic.

### 6. TensorFlow Dataset Creation

- Convert input IDs and label IDs into a TensorFlow Dataset.
- Shuffle and batch the dataset for training.

### 7. Model Training

- Use `TFDistilBertForTokenClassification` for token classification.
- Compile the model using an Adam optimizer and cross-entropy loss.
- Train the model for a few epochs (e.g., 3+) using the prepared dataset.
